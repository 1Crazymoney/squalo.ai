The system for detecting and identifying sharks and other marine life and objects is imposing. Its advanced deep neural networks and image processing techniques efficiently distinguish and identify sharks from other targets. It can process dynamic video feeds and analyze static images with great precision. Moreover, the system has an onboard megaphone that provides an overhead warning to swimmers and surfers if a shark or potential risk is detected. This cutting-edge AI system will undoubtedly positively impact the public by making recreational boats and swimming much safer. 

[Ameba Pro 2](https://www.amebaiot.com/en/amebapro2/#rtk_amb82_mini) has the remarkable capabilities to make Squalo AI an advanced technology that incorporates cutting-edge image processing techniques and state-of-the-art image sensors to detect and classify objects. Moreover, they employ deep-learning neural networks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of this process. The advancements in AI technology are awe-inspiring and hold potential for various applications.

The primary objective of this project is to refine the system's training to recognize great white sharks and hammerhead sharks in challenging conditions, such as murky water or unclear deep-sea conditions.

To address these challenges, an object detection system based on faster regions with convolutional neural networks has been proposed to detect shark species in real-time. The ResNet50 deep architecture serves as the feature extractor for model training. The developed shark detector has demonstrated impressive performance, with average scores of precision (0.82), recall (0.78), and accuracy (0.85) on experimental image and video datasets.

## Camera Installation

The N2K network has limited data bandwidth, and therefore, it does not support streaming video content. To connect Squalo AI, we recommend the network cable from Phoenix Contact part number 1407349 that uses the connector M8 â€¨(Coding: A / IP67).

To manage your camera's functionality (turn the device on and off), it is supplied with an NMEA 2000 Micro Male connector; the drop cable is not supplied with the device and should be purchased separately. For connection to the Raymarine SeaTalk NG network, use cables with Raymarine part numbers A06045 or A06075.

## Camera Enclosure Maintenance

Maintaining the locking nut securely fastened is imperative; therefore, it is recommended to carry out periodic inspections. We advise a monthly assessment of the camera module and cable connections to ensure their optimal condition. The glass lens can be kept clean using a plastic scraper or a soft brush, while abrasive cloths or cleaning agents should be avoided, as they could inflict irreparable damage to the lens. Furthermore, it is prudent to employ a high-quality antifouling system to coat the external body of the device, thus preventing the accumulation of marine growth and extending its lifespan. Regular coating renewal is necessary to maintain the device in excellent condition.

### Certifications

The Squalio AI camera device will be certified by the National Marine Electronics Association and is designed for operation in an NMEA 2000 network.
